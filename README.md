# employee-tracker

## Description
The objective of this project was to create a database of employees that is viewable and editable from the command line. MySQL is used for the database side and Inquirer was used to create the prompts that the user interacts with. After starting the program, the user will be asked if they'd like to view, add, or update. From there there are corresponding prompts that will guide the user through their choices.
